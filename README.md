# sentiment_analysis
I have done 2 types of sentiment analysis.


1. I have taken a labelled dataset and applied preprocessing steps, then i have used multinomialNB for the classification.
2. I have appiled text blob to know the numeric representation how much the data is positive, negative or neutral.
